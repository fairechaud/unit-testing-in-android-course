    "Reverse engineering APIs and logic in order to design unit tests introduces problems. Some issues associated with deducing unit tests based on production code:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is hard to deduce requirements just by looking at the public APIs: In real code you'll find complex classes tasked with many responsibilities, inferring test requirements from APIs becomes close to impossible\n",
    "+ You'll most likely be testing your own code, your own design: you should try to force a blackbox analysis on the code during implementation to avoid intrinsic bias\n",
    "+ Can't know whether all the requirements were tested: 100% line coverage doesn't mean that you have tested ALL possible scenarios, it just guarantees that you tested the scenarios the code accounts for\n",
    "+ Test writing after production code = Boring\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution for these problems is writing the tests BEFORE you write the production code. This is known as **Test Driven Development** or TDD"
